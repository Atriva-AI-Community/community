## Key Points
1. Edge AI is fragmented and domain-specific  
2. Real hardware, real sensors, real cameras → cannot be simulated by cloud AI  
3. Hardware targets require different optimization stacks  
4. Fully auto-generated apps become unmaintainable  
5. Human engineers + PMs still define real customer needs
