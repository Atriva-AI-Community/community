# 🌍 Atriva AI Community

Welcome to the **Atriva AI Community** — an open initiative helping developers and graduates learn how to **build real-world Edge AI products**.

Our goal is to empower developers to think beyond algorithms — to understand the **entire lifecycle of an AI product**, from data to deployment.

---

## 🧭 Mission

We’re building a community that:
- 💡 Helps engineers learn *product-thinking* in AI development  
- 🤝 Encourages open collaboration on modular, real-world projects  
- 🧠 Bridges the gap between **open learning** and **industry application**  
- ⚙️ Makes Edge AI accessible across hardware platforms (RK3588, Jetson, Pi, etc.)

## 🪴 What Lives Here

This repository serves as the **community hub** for:
- Contribution guidelines  
- Code of Conduct  
- Governance and collaboration rules  
- Open roadmap (community edition)  
- Learning and documentation links

## ⚖️ Open & Sustainable

Atriva AI supports this community through a **hybrid open-core model**:
- 🔓 Core tools, templates, and docs remain open source
- 🔒 Commercial modules for enterprise deployment and advanced infrastructure will remain proprietary
- 💰 Proceeds help fund ongoing community growth, hardware sponsorships, and developer grants

> This ensures a sustainable, long-term ecosystem — where open learning stays free, and professional solutions remain supported.
